    <h3 style="padding-top:30px;">What is the pricing structure for artwork purchase on your platform?</h3>
    <p>
      There are four options: file download, printed posters (both framed and unframed), artist-supervised print and new work commission.
    </p>
    <p id="download-option">
      1. <em>File download</em> gives collector a link to download the source file for personal use only. For example, (s)he can print out the image on a t-shirt, a mug or simply use their home printer to output the image. We provide a license, which clearly outlines all the rights enjoyed by our users in regards to the specific purchased image file. This is the cheapest option: $5.00 - $10.00 for images in an open edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, if you want to use the images for commercial purposes, we will ask you to reach out to us and create a separate licensing agreement.
    </p>
    <p id="prints-option">
      2. Printed poster option is fairly straightforward. Instead of having to mess with the files and getting inconsistent, and sometimes less-than-perfect results, the collector has an option of getting a beautiful professional print sent to her address. The final price will vary based on size, shipping costs and wherever or not a frame is needed. Edition is open.
    </p>
    <p id="artist-managed-option">
      3. To produce Artist-managed print we work directly with the artist to create a print at the size, output material and color management specified by her/him. This process is meticulously managed by the artist. S/he examines the work before it is shipped to the address you provide. Generally, these prints are a part of an open edition. In some cases, the edition will be closed based on arrangements made with past buyers or material and time limitations. The final price will vary based on materials and shipping costs. Each work comes with a certificate of authenticity originated by the artist.
    </p>
    <p id="commision-option">
      4. Commissioning new work is one of the most exciting ways to interface with artists. We will present to you a package (cost of travel + lodging + artist fee) for specific type of output. For an artist, this is a micro-residency, for a collector it is a chance to meet the artist and learn directly from their working process.
    </p>
    <h3>So why should artists "give away" their digital files so cheaply on your platform?</h3>
    <p>
      The distribution costs to the artist are minimal. In fact, the biggest costs are really promotional. For each work sold at $5.00, the artist gets paid $3.00 (60%)  Our goal is to be able reach large enough audiences to make a digital-first distribution a viable option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the basic arithmetic. Normally, an artist gets paid 50% of the sales price and has to bare all the cost of production. Let’s pretend the said artist sold a limited edition print for $1000.00, (s)he receives $500.00 from the sale. Given the cost of printing and framing, not even counting personal time of the creator deidcated to sales management, we are roughly at $300.00 This means that for every reasonably-priced limited edition photo sale, we have to match it with one hundred downloads to provide artist with equvalent financing. Given the economies of scale that the interwebz make accessible, we believe that this is a very achievable goal.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I transfer ownership of the file?</h3>
    <p>
      In case you need to to transfer the image file ownership, we will be more than happy to help you. In this case we will generate a new license file associated with the image and it’s new owner.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is “artist-managed print” important?</h3>
    <p>
      It signals artist’s intention. The way s/he wants us to see the image. A collecting institution, for example, can purchase an artist-managed print and keep it in storage for reference. Each time the work is exhibited the institution will have an option to print new exhibition copies of the work from the files they purchase.
    </p>
    <h3>What percentage of sales profit is given to the artist?</h3>
    <p>
      The artist is guaranteed at least 60% of the profit. In most cases our commision is much lower than 40% of the profit and we take on the credit card processing fees. It really is about the artist and his/her financial well-being. Plus we don’t have physical rent overhead, so we can afford to be generous :)
    </p>
    <h3>I noticed that your organization does not have a New York address. <br /> Where is Lexington, Kentucky and why base your activities there?</h3>
    <p>A little about the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky" target="_new">home base</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Interwebz are grand and we work with artists and collectors from all over the world. It’s a cheaper zip code than most of the world’s art capitals and we think that our geographic location adds quite a bit to the diversity of views and places that can make up the contemporary art world conversation.
    </p>
    <h3>Speaking of working with artists… Can I send my work to you for review?</h3>
    <p>
      Sure. We generally have major artwork releases planned about 6 months ahead but that doesn’t mean we are not looking. We always love to see new art. Ping us via email or Instagram and we will definitely ping you back if we are interested. Please allow up to 3 weeks for your work to be reviewed.
    </p>
    <h3>Are you guys a for-profit or not-for-profit entity?</h3>
    <p>
      We feel that since the core of our mission is <b><em>to change the overall conversation around artwork distribution</em></b>, not-for-profit status will give us a better (read: more impartial) position. To this end we have launched this project in public beta and intend to report on our successes and failures in as open of a fashion as possible. We officially have a 501C3 status.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the issues with making observations about today’s artworld is its opaqueness. Unless a work goes to an auction, information on the pricing of the work is not publically available. We want to change this. To this end, we are an open data and open source organization.
